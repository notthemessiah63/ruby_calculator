# ruby_calculator
Create calculator.rb file
First created loop structure to call basic/advanced calculator, or quit
Created function tags for all functions required, which was all of em!
Created basic calculator.
For each remaining function developed all the input/output calls/dispays.
Coded all the functions (advanced calculator basics first).
Found I have flaws in maths in some functions.. probably summat simple.
Am pooped. Am in bed, was hoping to read ruby Monk stuff.. but dont think it will sink in
Gonna try and read up on that on the train from Cambridge to London in the morning.
I will ask about my maths issues in the morning.. Only coded in ruby for a day.. not quite 
an expert yet!!
